Self driving cars capture images of the surrounding frequently. This system uses those image to detect objects
(80 classes) present in the image.

This system uses 23-layer deep CNN + Yolo algorithm to detect atmost 80 objects in a image

This project was developed as a part of coursera's deep learning.ai course's assignment and starter code with important utility 
functions were already provided by the course instructors.
