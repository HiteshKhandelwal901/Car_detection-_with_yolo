Self driving cars have a camera mounted on them whihc clicks pictures of the environment. This system uses those image to detect objects
(80 classes) present in the image.

This system uses 23-layer deep Convolutional neural network  + Yolo algorithm to detect atmost 80 objects in a image

This project was developed as a part of deep learning.ai course's assignment on coursera and starter code with few important utility 
functions were already provided the course instructors.
